# Spotify-User-Preference-Exploration

A visualization using [Spotify daily charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) data.

## Intro

This visualization is mainly focused on presenting the discovery about people's music taste through the exploration of data got from Spotify. Itâ€™s expected that after looking into this visualization, the audience finds it interesting and know more about what the others around the world are listening. Practically, it might make people more interested in data analysis and Spotify.

Audiences are expected to grab a comprehensive view of how music tastes varies among different countries, trends of people's favorite music, what are the characteristics of popular songs. There are also two interesting discoveries about the seasonality of people listening to music and people's tendency to listen to famous singers' songs, (or people's tastes are alike!).

## Design choices

Music is an interesting topic, so a visualization about music should be fancy, too. I used several interactive elements and beautiful charts to present my exploration and discovery on the Spotify data. The color chosen for the story is Spotify's theme color. It's expected that music lovers can have fun playing with my visualization and know more about the songs that accompany them day after day.
